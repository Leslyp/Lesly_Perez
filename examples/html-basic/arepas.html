    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Chef Ryan Pera, Coltivare Pizza & Garden, Houston, learned the art of arepas from his sister-in-law. Now, this recipe is his easy Sunday meal of choice, packed with leftovers or farm-fresh produce.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups of arepa flour (precooked cornmeal)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>Desired fillings (such as shredded cooked chicken or pork, stewed black beans with cheese and lime, corn salad with onion and fresh herbs; for serving)</li>
      <li>Lime wedges (for serving)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients Info</h2>
    <p>
      Arepa flour is precooked corn flour, not to be confused with masa harina. Sometimes sold as masarepa or harina precocida, it can be found in Latin markets and some supermarkets.
    </p>
    <h2>Preperation:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine arepa flour and salt in a medium bowl. Make a well in the center and add 2½ cups warm water.
      </li>
      <li>
         Using a wooden spoon, gradually incorporate dry ingredients, stirring until no dry lumps remain. Let rest 5 minutes to hydrate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Knead dough a few times in bowl, then divide into 8 pieces. Roll each piece on work surface into a ball, then gently flatten to about ½” thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add 4 arepas, cover, and cook until golden brown, 6–8 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
         Uncover, flip, and cook (keep uncovered) until other side is golden brown, 6–8 minutes.
      </li>  
      <li>
        Transfer arepas to a wire rack. Repeat with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil and dough.
Split arepas and stuff with desired fillings; serve with lime wedges for squeezing over.
      </li>
    </ol>
